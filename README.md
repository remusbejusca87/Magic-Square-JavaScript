# Magic-Square-JavaScript
We define a magic square to be an n x n matrix of distinct positive integers from 1 to n^2 where the sum of any row, column, 
or diagonal of length n is always equal to the same number: the magic constant.

You will be given a 3 x 3 matrix s of integers in the inclusive range [1, 9].
We can convert any digit a to any other digit b in the range [1, 9] at cost of |a-b| . Given the matrix s,
convert it into a magic square at minimal cost. Print this cost on a new line.
